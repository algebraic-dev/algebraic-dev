## ☄️ About Me 
Hi, I'm a 21yo cute girl that likes to program some crazy or useless tools in pure functional programming languages.

## 💌 Things i like
- ⚗️ I love *magic*, like in the movies or games, so I try to do a lot of things related to that. 
- 🖌️ Sometimes i try to draw.

## 🤌 Languages that i use 
- 🦀 **Rust** I love this language, It's the only language that performs well and has a lot of functional constructs.
- 4️⃣ **Lean4** Useful to make your programs stronger with the use of dependent types
